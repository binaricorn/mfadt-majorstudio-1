# Ideas in Form: 1D

For my ideas in form, I was really interested in exploring how one might experience sound in a physical space, and what might happen if our movements could trigger sound. Would we be more intentional with our body? Would listening become a more active act? 

In my narrative, I go through the average, well-meaning person's day.

*Monday morning. You wake up, roll over in bed and do your daily morning social media check. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat. Someone from your high school got married. Your colleague got that promotion they wanted. You see a post about donating to your local animal shelter. You love animals, maybe you'll donate later -- but you're late to work so you've got to scurry.

You barely slip through the subway doors before they close. As you commute to work, you whip out your phone and scroll again. You've been invited to a protest at Union Square. They're protesting Trump of something? You RVSP "maybe."

You hop off the subway and begin to walk the few blocks between the subway stop and work. You take the same route every time. You're rushing past the same old Footlocker when suddenly you hear a crash and crackling. 

You stop, panicked, and look around for a burning building. But the Footlocker is still standing. As you approach, the sound gets louder and clearer. On the store front, you see a plaque. It reads:

"Of the dozen hotels targeted by the saboteurs on November 25, 1864, only a portion of the St. Nicholas—once one of the grandest hotels in New York—still remains. The original building stretched most of the block south from Spring Street and featured rooms for nearly a thousand people, a popular restaurant, barber shop, and ballrooms. Of all the targets of the Confederate plot, the St. Nicholas suffered the worst damage. Four separate rooms were set ablaze and the front of the building burned quite badly; as is often the case, most of the lasting damage was from the water used to quench the fire. The remaining fragment of the hotel now houses a Puma store and a Lady Foot Locker. "

"Although slavery and the Confederacy is over, white supremacy and the KKK still exists and is currently thriving in our political climate. Now, more than ever, we must band together to combat white supremacy so history does not repeat itself: see how you can help at ACLU.org"*

My idea behind this was to bring back the historical context of places that have become so commonplace we have forgotten it. The purpose is to confront passersby and turn the passive into the active. The "passive" act in this is the act of listening, and also the bystander's passivity in (sl)ac(k)tivism.
