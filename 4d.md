For my 4D project, I pivoted yet. I wanted to keep my theme of sound, but I pretty much abandoned my previous ideas about sounds + public space.

I pondered about time. What it is, how it is. It's relative depending on where you are or who you are. Different planets have longer or shorter days. For children, time feels like it passes slower because proportionally, it's a larger part of their life. Animals don't really have a concept of time like humans; they just know the sun comes up and it comes down.

In music, there's ways you can tell and count time. There's time signatures that denote how many beats are in a measure and what type of note each beat it. There's tempo, which is normally described in italian/latin terms, but are also assigned a range of BPM (beats per minute).

We experience time as it is now in 4/4 time, in larghetto tempo, or 60 bpm.

But what if we could set our own tempo? Time signature?

In 3/4 time, at a tempo of adaggio, (75bpm), a day would be 40% faster.

For this, I created a sketch in processing and a made a watch out of wire to stimulate this adjustment in time.
