# Ideas in Form - 1D

## Identify what language is
* About my five-in-five project, I talked to different people from different countries, discussed with them about their own language. From this experience, I start to think about how people communicate. Is there any other method for communication?

*I noticed besides speaking language, people can also communicate with body language, sign language, facial expression. People also love visual languages, guidepost, street nameplate, city lights in our public areas…any signs that we see in out daylily life are for communication.

*There are also lots of communications happening in our body. Cells communicate with each other by chemical signal. Our brain communicates with different organs and different parts of our body also send messages back to our brain.

*Apart from human beings’ communications, I am curious about how other species talk to each other. Can we talk to animals? There are lots of animal languages, animals also communicate by visual, listing, chemical signals, touch, and electrical signals. Like whale live in deep ocean talk to each other by sonic wave; bees wave their wings to not only fly but also create vibration to send messages; dogs like to make labels. 

*Besides human, animals’ communication, machines also have their own language.  For example, computer has it own language, the language follow math logic. Human tried to talk to computers, so we use coding language. This also reminds me AI (Artificial Intelligence).

*Through my brainstorm, I got many new ideas and interested. But also made me more confused, I don’t know where to start because of too many aspects.
