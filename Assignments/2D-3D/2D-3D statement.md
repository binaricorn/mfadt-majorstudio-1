# 2D - 3D - Narrative Research

### [See Presentation Slides](https://github.com/iristy318/mfadt-majorstudio-1/blob/master/Assignments/2D-3D/2D%263D_0916.pdf)

## Main Concerns
* How do you want your concept to be experienced?
* How will your representations of your ideas communicate your concepts?
* Does changing the medium change the way you think about your original concept?
* How do my materials & execution show the intention, without me telling the audience everything?

## Concept
