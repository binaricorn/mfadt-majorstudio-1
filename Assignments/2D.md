# 2D: Flatlands

I detoured a bit from my 1D Narratives idea after the class's feedback. One interesting suggestion was to think more about what actually happens (with the computer, with me, etc) while creating a neural network.

For the 2D project, I followed [this tutorial](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python) in order to get started with making my own Deep Learning model: a simple handwritten number classifier. The tutorial's outcome is just a .m5 file — a black box inaccessible to any layperson.

As an experiment, I collected as much data as possible during the training process. This included my computer's activity (CPU, memory, power consumption, etc) as well as my own (time, date, location, people in the room, etc). For example, training the model consumed approx. 0.0219 kWh, which amounts to 0.0044238 USD in energy costs.

All of this lead me to the question whether information like this should be disclosed together with machine learning models when they are published. It could be beneficial for discourse and evaluation if we knew more about who made the software we use, what training data they used, and so on.

As a speculative artefact, I created a form to record this neural net metadata. It hints at a fictional government agency that controls distribution and licensing of machine learning models. The design is adapted from a W-2 tax report form.
