# 9/1: Remix

For today I decided to not (over)think things and just follow my gut to make *anything*. I ended up combining pictures I took at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden with sound recordings of the city's traffic.  

I used a iPhone for sound recording, took photos using a Leica M8 camera and edited the video in Adobe Premiere.

Combining these sounds with imagery of nature is a juxtaposition of some sort. However, a botanical garden is nature embedded in an artificial environment and thus doesn't really oppose the soundscape. It might be in line with sounds of artifical, man-made infrastructure.

While the outcome of this project felt arbitrary at first, it led me to thinking more about my recordings as well as how they can be interpreted:

In the U.S. (or at least the places I've visited), the decaying roads and public transportation infrastructure creates an iconing soundscape. The rumbling of wheels and subway cars over abyssal potholes, the unashamed overuse of horns, and the loudest engines I have ever heard are iconally American to me.

These sounds could be pointers to larger societal and political themes. I will name examples of what I am thinking of without providing further research or sources. Thus, they are merely speculative:
1. Loud roads and tracks: decaying infrastructure in the US; political failure to address modernization.
2. Loud engines, honking: No sensitivity to noise pollution or health hazards; willingness of population to stand these issues, either without acting upon them or without success in fighting them
