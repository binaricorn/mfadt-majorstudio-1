In this 1945 paper, Bush gives his perspective on what scientists should devote their time to after being employed in war-related research during WW2. He calls for scientists to devote their collective knowledge to “the application of science to the needs and desires of man.”

Bush describes several visions (or research proposals) for advancements that would help to document and access knowledge. Things we today know as mass photography, speech and brain interfaces, personal computers, hypertext, and Wikipedia.

Every idea is derived from existing research at the time and never overly speculative as, in Bush's words, “prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess”.

Bush sees the need for these inventions not as a ‘natural progression’ of mankind, but as a necessity created by man-made complexity of our civilization. In that sense, his perspective is techno-deterministic: he never considers anything but technology as logical advancement.
