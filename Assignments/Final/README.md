# When IoT talks

#### Introduction
When IoT talks is an Internet of Things project and an interactive installation that uses physical computing, NodeJS, and Raspberry Pi in order to simulate a speculative scenario when all household objects are connected via the Internet. My audience is the household objects and the owners and I want to give them a storytelling + future experience with current technologies.
