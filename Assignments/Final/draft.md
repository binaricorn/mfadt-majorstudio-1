#### I. Introduction

This paper outlines a design project focused on discussing the boundaries between human and non-human things. It is a response to the phenomenon that this boundary is getting more and more blurry with the continuous development of technologies. It is designed at an angle of non-human things with human behavior. It creates a speculative scenario that humans can react. 

This project is an Internet of Things project and an interactive installation device that uses physical computing, NodeJS, and Raspberry Pi to simulate a speculative scenario when Internet connects all household objects. 

#### II. Background

2.1 Significance of design

Objects are designed with form, function, feeling. While whether “Form follows function” or the opposite way may still be a question, the focus on the feeling has undoubtedly created a strong engagement with consumers and has become the biggest selling point in many product designs. 

In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios produced the first movie of the Toy Story series. It created a world of anthropomorphic toys. The relation between the toys and their owner was complicated. On the one side, toys lived an unstable life. They could be easily abandoned when the owner moved to a new home. On the other hand, toys were watching the owner. Toys knew everything, and it sounded like that they could interfere the owner’s life easily. 

The animation movie can be fun and fictional. However, the wrestling based on the relations between human and non-human things since the industrial age occurred in many aspects. Anthropomorphism and objectification are two representations. 

Anthropomorphism puts human emotion and intention to non-human things. Some emerging trending technologies like the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are examples of applications of anthropomorphism. In contrast, objectification, especially instrumental objectification, nurtured by capitalist production, treats human as a comparable tool. For example, the world’s most profitable smartphones are made in factories where free will of human is not welcomed. Good or bad, human workers are facing a high risk of being replaced by robots.

The design based on this topic can be reached in multiple ways: human with missing human characteristics, non-human things with human characteristics, human interacting with non-human things, and the other way around. 

2.2 Design philosophy

The design of this project aims to reflect a small part out of hundreds of scenarios arising from the topic above. Having a form of interaction reinforces this reflection process. The audience needs to see, to hear, and to react. It helps the audience throw out questions. What is it going to be like? Is it funny? Is it scary? Will the audience be emotionally engaged or being indifferent? What are the other scenarios? 

2.3 Universe-centered design

Human-centered design is the backbone of this design century. At the time when it was being raised, it provided a systematic approach to evaluate a design process. However, often we found it difficult to analyze the results as the scope grows bigger and bigger, and both the environmental and non-human factors are less likely being taken care of. The impact can be so profound, at such a global scale that no individual can notice and estimate the consequence. In such cases, should a new design approach be proposed so that a “universe” testing can be run? Should more universal metrics be added into consideration? 

2.4 Speculative

There is a time gap between current social structure and the future. Although most of the big companies are heavily investing in the human-like technologies, there is still a long run before the scale, and the details of objects can be fully covered. 

#### III. Research

3.1 What happened to the future

Five years from now, there will be 50 billion[] of data-spouting devices connected to the Internet：commuting tools, household objects, public space installations, and sporting goods.

3.2 Superintelligence

Artificial Intelligence has made tremendous progress in the past ten years. It is leveraging human intelligence and going towards the way to surpass human intelligence. 

3.3 Human vs. Non-human

Smithsonian[] listed several human characteristics including walking upright, tools & food, body shapes, human brains, social life, language & symbols, and human’s impact on the world. Non-human usually shares some of the characteristics above but not all of them.

3.4 Machine language

-WiFi, Bluetooth, 2G/3G/4G cellular[], Thread
-Assembly language, bit
-Morse code

3.5 Digital identity

Digital identity is the identity claimed in a network environment. It is linked to digital identifiers like username, email, online activity.
