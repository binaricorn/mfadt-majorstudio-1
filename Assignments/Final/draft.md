#### I. Introduction

This paper outlines a design project focused on discussing the boundaries between human and non-human things. It is a response to the phenomenon that this boundary is getting more and more blurry with the continuous development of technologies. It adds human behavior to non-human things. It sets up an interactive stage where the audience can react.

This project is an Internet of Things project and an interactive installation device that uses physical computing, NodeJS, and Raspberry Pi to simulate a speculative scenario that Internet equips all household objects. 

#### II. Background

2.1 Significance of design

Objects are designed with form, function, and feeling. While whether “form follows function” or the opposite way may still be a question, the focus on the feeling has undoubtedly created a strong engagement with consumers and has become the biggest selling point in many product designs. 

In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios produced the first movie of the "Toy Story" series. It created a world of anthropomorphic toys. The relation between the toys and their owner was complicated. On the one hand, toys lived an unstable life. They could be quickly abandoned when the owner moved to a new home. On the other way, toys were watching the owner. Toys knew everything, and it sounded like that they could interfere with the owner’s life easily. 

Animated films can be fun and fictional. However, anthropomorphism is a real psychological phenomenon. Human tends to put human emotion and intention to non-human things. Some emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are examples of the application of anthropomorphism. In fact, wrestling based on the relations between human and non-human things since the industrial revolution has occurred in many aspects. 

Objectification, especially instrumental objectification, nurtured by capitalist production, treats human as a comparable tool. For example, the world’s most profitable smartphones are made in factories where the free will of human is not welcomed. Good or bad, human workers are facing a high risk of being replaced by robots.

The design based on this topic can be reached in multiple ways: human with missing human characteristics, non-human things with human characteristics, human interacting with non-human things, and the other way around. 

2.2 Design philosophy

The design of this project aims to reflect a small part out of hundreds of scenarios arising from the topic above. Having a form of interaction reinforces this reflection process. The audience needs to see, to hear, and to feel. It helps the audience throw out questions. What is it going to be like? Is it funny? Is it scary? Will the audience be emotionally engaged or being indifferent? What are the other scenarios? 

2.3 Universe-centered design

Human-centered design is the backbone of this design century. At the time this approach emerged, it provided a systematic approach to evaluate a design process. However, often we found both the contextual and non-human factors are less likely being taken care of. The impact can be so profound, at such a global scale that no individual can notice and estimate the consequence. In such cases, should a new design approach be proposed so that a “universe” testing can be run? Should more universal metrics be added and taken into consideration? 

Universe-centered design means extending the main character being studied in a design process to not just humans, but to the ones that do not use verbal communication, do not have many emotions, who are static and stubborn.

2.4 Speculative presentation

There is a time gap between current societal structure and the future. Although most of the big companies are heavily investing in anthropomorphic technologies, there is still a long run before a variety of objects can be fully covered. 

#### III. Research

3.1 What happens to the future

Five years from now, there will be 50 billion data-spouting devices[] connected to the Internet：commuting tools, household objects, public space installations, sporting goods, even food.

3.2 Superintelligence

Artificial Intelligence has made tremendous progress in the past ten years. It is leveraging human intelligence and waving towards surpassing human intelligence.

3.3 Human vs. Non-human

Smithsonian[] listed several human characteristics including walking upright, tools & food, body shapes, human brains, social life, language & symbols, and human’s impact on the world. Non-humans usually share some of the characteristics above but not all of them.

3.4 Machine language

-WiFi, Bluetooth, 2G/3G/4G cellular[], Thread

-Assembly language, bit

-Morse code

3.5 Digital identity

Digital identity is the identity claimed in a network environment. It is linked to digital identifiers like username, email, and online activity.

#### IV. Proposal

4.1 Purpose of this project

This project uses two symbolic objects with some human characteristics as an example, sets up an interactive scenario in which objects can see and can talk. Data extracting is no longer the primary purpose of IoT. Instead, they interpret the information from the environment and use it directly. It is evidence that objects can eventually achieve identifying themselves digitally and physically. More importantly, there is not much intelligence needed. As compared with smart new-style objects, they are so simple that usually, the audience may not pay any attention.

4.2 Audience

This project targets the following types of audience:
-Household owners who usually ignore everyday objects

-People who are interested in the Internet of Things future

-People who are interested in non-human things

-People who are interested in a different way of communication 

4.3 Conceptual prototype

The first prototype is a web interface with an illustration of the kitchen and a conversational script about the conversation between a toaster and a trashcan.

4.4 Aesthetic prototype

Two physical objects are presented with the servo motor and LED communicating with morse code.

4.5 User testing

In the first round of prototype test

-The audience thinks that if IoT objects can talk to each other in the future home, the conversation could be "funny" or "scary" or "boring".

-Two of the audience prefer physical interaction. 

In the second round of prototype test

-It is not very clear that the objects are using morse code. 

-The size may still be a problem. Also if using Arduino, then it is going to be all wire connected. 

-It needs to be more like a conversation, i.e., when one of the objects is "talking", then maybe the other should be waiting. 

-A camera module can be added to detect what is happening around and trigger reactions.

4.6 Future scope

Combine the project with artificial intelligence, so that different objects can have different personalities.
