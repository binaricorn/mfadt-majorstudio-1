# MFADT Major Studio 1 Assignments

We'll go on the wild ride of ideation together, and learn about the world and each other.

## Part 1
#### [5 in 5](five-in-five.md)
#### [(In class) Brainstorm around interest areas and research domains](brainstorm-domains.md)

#### Ideas in Form
For the next 3 weeks weâ€™ll be working from 1D to 4D to explore how the form you choose affects and changes: 
* the message and meaning of the inquiry 
* the experience created.

Pick one project from your 5-in-5 assignment and make it your thematic focus for the next 4 projects. 
Think about:  the message you wanted to communicate, the feeling you wanted it to give, the topic you want to do more research on, and the series of questions that arose while you were making it
