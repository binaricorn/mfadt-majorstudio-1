# 5 in 5

I disregarded most rule suggestions from the post-it notes because they were concerned with using only certain colors and generally the visual outcome of a project. For my MFA I am not very interested in these aesthetics (although they're of course part of anything I make), but care more about developing good ideas and developing my practice as a designer/artist.  

With this in mind I thought that I could make my 5-in-5 about creating tools to cultivate ideas.

## Assignment guidelines
* For the next five days, create one project per day. Each project must be conceptualized, produced and documented in a single day. 
* The more experimental the better.
* Usage of skills learned in other classes is encouraged.
* Monday is Labor Day (no class) but post a link with documentation of your work on Github by EOD on Monday

## Presentation guidelines
* On Wednesday, 9/6
* 7 minutes presentation each person
* 30 minutes group discussion afterwards

## Questions
* What are some rules you put in place for your project?
* What is the relationship between concept and execution?
* Is there something that ties the projects together?
* How could you have improved them?
* Did you enjoy the exercise, why or why not? What were some struggles?
