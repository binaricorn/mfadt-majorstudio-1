## Creative Fiction
The bright morning light coming through your east-facing window awakens you. You lay still with your eyes closed, dreading getting up. You can hear the J train pass, and the birds outside chirp regardless. Your mattress feels good beneath you and so do the blankets that cover your body. Your arms stretch up, you open your eyes -- but... something is off. The room is bright but there is no shadow on the wall where your eyes expect them to be. You run to the window and itâ€™s the view of Brooklyn, just like any other morning. You touch the window but it is freezing cold despite the sunlight. You see a see a train coming, but notice a static black dot travel along the length of the cars. It is a pixel. The rumbling of the tracks becomes more apparent. It is from the corner of your ceiling. You rip off the panel and find a motor... it squeaks just as those birds outside. You turn around and tear the sheets off your bed in disorientation... they are just a thousand mechanical pistons forming to your body. And the covers? an invisible humid mist...
