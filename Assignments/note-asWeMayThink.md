# As We May Think

Dr. Vannevar Bush was the head of OSRD. He provided a pioneering thought on a system called "memex" which eventually evolved to the invention of the digital computer. 

A memex, as what he pictured, should be a device that stored one individual's books, stories, communications. He mapped the mechanism to a list of things that people were familiar with and stated that "All this is conventional". 

The origin of his concept started with a problem that the storage of knowledge, at the time of 1945, had no difference as compared to hundreds of years ago. 

He also predicted that this would not be an individual work. Scientists, engineers need to work together. The wall between different disciplines needs to broke in order to achieve the goal. 

Bush himself is a generalist. This made him own the ability to conquer and combine the fields that nobody had ever gone to and also encounter the problems that were seldom discovered.
