I see a lot of parallels bettween what Bush says about computing (in various forms) and what we are saying today about AI. There are a lot
of applicable domains and ther are a lot of potential results but we are at a point now where we can more or less conceive of the chain
of events requuired to make AI happen. I think that then as now there is a visionary person or set of people who know what the potential
impact is of this new approach or new technology and they are fighting for more people to think more creatively about the future. 

I find it interesting, or maybe comforting that the technology exactly as Bush describes it doesn't come about for many decades after
the time of writing. It lends hope to our more far fetched ideas and research that at some point those ideas could come to fruition. 

I appreciate that he was coming out of wartime science and design and was able to leave that mindset and design and think for peacetime. I
feel like the present day equivalent of scientists who have been working on war and surveillance tech are not able to conceive of a time
when there isn't a need to always think about militaristic implications of tech.
